# Neural Network

This repository contains a simple neural network program coded in Python that takes 3  inputs consisting of (0 or 1) and returns a logical value as output.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone or download this repository to your local machine. You will need Python and the following libraries installed:
- numpy

## Running the Program

The program can be run by executing the `neural_network.py` file in your Python environment. The neural network has been trained to recognize 3 inputs(0 or 1), where if first input is 1, then it will return an output of 1 and if its 0  will return an output of 0.
NB:  In both cases balance 2 inputs value doesnt matter.

### Input
The neural network takes 3 inputs, which must be either 0 or 1

### Output
The neural network returns a single output, which will be a  value of either 0 or 1 depending on the input provided.

## Training the Neural Network

Dont worry Iam a trained neural network :)

## Notes

Please note that this is a simple implementation of a neural network and is intended for educational or demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for use in any real-world applications.
